Data Analysis with Python
Welcome to this repository containing Jupyter notebooks with Python code for a course on data analysis!

Course Overview
This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and techniques in data analysis using Python. You will learn how to manipulate, summarize, and visualize data using a variety of tools and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. By the end of this course, you will be able to effectively use Python to perform data analysis tasks in a variety of contexts.

Getting Started
To get started with the course, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. We recommend using the Anaconda distribution, which includes many of the libraries and tools you will need for this course.

Once you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, you can download the Jupyter notebooks for the course and start working through them. The notebooks are organized by topic and contain a mix of explanations, code examples, and exercises to help you practice and reinforce your learning.
